# IAM

## 1. Users

- Identity and Access Management
- Global service
- Root account created by default, should not be used or shared
- Users : are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- Groups only contain users, not other groups
- User do not have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

## 2. IAM: Permissions

- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
- These policies define the permissions of the users
- In AWS, you apply the least privilege principle: do not give more permissions than a user needs

### 2.1 Add User
